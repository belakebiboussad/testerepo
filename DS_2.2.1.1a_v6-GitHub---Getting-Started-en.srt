In the previous video, you learned about Git and GitHub. Before you continue with this video,

1
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,000
register for a GitHub account and log in. Let’s start by creating a new repository.

2
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:33,040
Click + then click New Repository. To create a new repository, you need to provide

3
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:40,160
these details: give your new repository a name; optionally, add a description of your repository;

4
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,240
choose the repository visibility - whether you want it to be public or private; and choose the option

5
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:53,160
to Initialize this repository with readme file. Then click Create Repository.

6
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,720
You will now be redirected to the repository you have created.

7
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:05,920
The root folder of your repository is listed by default and it has just one file ReadMe.md.

8
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,320
Now, it’s time to edit the readme. You can do this in your browser. Just click the pencil to open the

9
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,800
online editor and you can change the text of the readme. To save your changes to the repository,

10
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:26,160
you must commit them. After you have made your changes, scroll down to the Commit changes

11
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:33,760
section. Add a commit message and optionally add a description, then click Commit changes. The

12
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:41,760
"commit changes" is used to save your changes to the repository. Go back to the home screen by

13
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:48,480
clicking the repository name link. Note that the readme file is updated and verify your changes.

14
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,000
Let’s learn how to create a new file using the built-in web editor provided by GitHub which

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,800
runs in the browser. Click Add File, then click Create New File to create the new file.

16
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,840
To create a python file called firstpython.py.

17
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:15,200
First, provide the file name. Next, add a comment that describes your code, then add the code.

18
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:24,000
Once finished, commit the change to the repository. You can see that your file is

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,240
now added to the repository and the repository listing shows when the file was added or changed.

20
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,480
When you need to change the file, you can edit it again.

21
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,920
Click the file name, and then click the pencil icon, make your edits and commit the changes.

22
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,600
You can also upload a file from your local system into the repository.

23
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:51,360
From the home screen of the repository, click Add File and choose the Upload files option.

24
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,160
Click Choose Your Files and select the files you want to upload from your local system.

25
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,800
The file upload process may take a short time,

26
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,120
depending on what you are uploading. Once the files finish uploading,

27
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:14,880
click Commit Changes. The repository now reflects the files that were uploaded. In this video,

28
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:26,560
you learned how to create a repository, edit files, and commit changes using the web interface.
